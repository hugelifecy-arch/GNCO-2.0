    title: 'OECD Pillar Two — Global Minimum Tax in Force',
    summary: 'The OECD 15% global minimum corporate tax (Pillar Two / GloBE Rules) is now in force in Luxembourg from 1 January 2024. This affects Luxembourg fund management companies — not the funds themselves — where the top-line group revenue exceeds EUR 750 million.',
    detail: 'Luxembourg implemented the EU Minimum Tax Directive (Directive 2022/2523) via the Law of 22 December 2023. The Income Inclusion Rule (IIR) and Undertaxed Profits Rule (UTPR) apply to MNE groups with annual consolidated revenue of EUR 750M or above in at least two of the preceding four fiscal years. Investment funds themselves are excluded from Pillar Two scope as they qualify as Excluded Entities under Article 2(3) of the Directive. However, the fund management company (AIFM, ManCo) may fall within scope if it is part of a qualifying MNE group. Verify with your Luxembourg tax adviser whether your management structure triggers Pillar Two obligations.',
